## Election Details

If you want to vote in the EGM, you need to [make sure you have CompSoc membership](/join 'Click to go to the EUSA CompSoc membership page.').

We also allow people to run on the night if you did not have time to create manifestos.

We hope you think carefully about who you choose to elect tomorrow — please vote based on manifestos and speeches! Note that you may also vote for RON (reopen nominations) for any position. You also need EUSA CompSoc membership.

Election candidates - please remember that if you are running for President, VP, Secretary or Treasurer, your speech may be up to 2 minutes. Other roles have up to 1 minute. If you haven't gotten membership yet, **do that now**!

See you tomorrow,

CompSoc ❤️ You!
