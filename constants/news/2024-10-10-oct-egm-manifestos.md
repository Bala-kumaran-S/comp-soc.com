## Election Details

Our EGM/STMU is happening on October 23rd, at 18:00 in **G.07** of the Informatics Forum.

If you want to vote in the EGM, you need to **[make sure you have CompSoc membership](https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/activities/view/compsoc)**.

We also allow people to run on the night, if you did not have time to create manifestos.

_The views expressed on the following manifestos are the candidates' own and do not represent those of CompSoc. They are hosted here for the purposes of facilitating EUSA elections._

| Role                     | Name                   | Manifesto Link                                                                                       |

We hope you think carefully about who you choose to elect tonight â€” please vote based on manifestos and speeches! Note that you may also vote for RON (reopen nominations) for all positions. You also need EUSA CompSoc membership.

See you on Wednesday,

CompSoc <3 You!
