## Election Details

Our AGM is happening tonight, at 18:00! We'll first have a talk by Andrew representing Tardis, and after pizza we'll have speeches and voting!

If you want to vote in the AGM, you need to [make sure you have CompSoc membership](/join 'Click to go to the EUSA CompSoc membership page.').

We also allow people to run on the night, if you did not have time to create manifestos. There are a few people who are running for positions, but aren't available for the AGM (primarily, they're studying abroad), so please read through the manifestos thoroughly!

We hope you think carefully about who you choose to elect tonight â€” please vote based on manifestos and speeches! Note that you may also vote for RON (reopen nominations) for all positions. You also need EUSA CompSoc membership.

Election candidates - please remember that if you are running for President, VP, Secretary or Treasurer, your speech may be up to 2 minutes. Other roles have up to 1 minute. If you haven't gotten membership yet, do that now!

## Constitutional Amendments

We also have the following constitutional amendment to vote on:

- [Remove LawTech references following their secession](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/constitution/pull/36)

See you tonight,

CompSoc <3 You!
