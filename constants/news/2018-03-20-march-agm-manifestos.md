On Wednesday at 6pm we have our monthly Student Tech Meetup as well as our Annual General Meeting. Mark yourself as going [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/408493869580985/?ref=46) so we have enough food for you, and drop us a message if you have any special requirements.

We have a good number of people running for election, so once you've [reviewed the various positions](/elections), take a look at who is running for election!

If you haven't submitted a manifesto and would still like to run for election, please read [the elections page](/elections).
