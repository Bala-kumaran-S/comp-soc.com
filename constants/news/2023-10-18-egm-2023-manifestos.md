## Election Details

Our October EGM is happening at 18:00 Wednesday 25th October! After our first talk (and pizza), we'll have speeches and voting!

If you want to vote in the EGM, you need to **[make sure you have CompSoc membership](/join)**.

We also allow people to run on the night, if you did not have time to create manifestos.

_The views expressed on the following manifestos are the candidates' own and do not represent those of CompSoc. They are hosted here for the purposes of facilitating EUSA elections._

Election candidates - please remember that your speech may be up to 1 minute in length. If you haven't gotten membership yet, **do that now**!
