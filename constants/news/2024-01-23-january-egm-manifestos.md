## Election Details

Our EGM is happening at **18:00 Wednesday 31st January 2024**! After our first talk (and pizza), we'll have speeches and voting!

If you want to vote in the EGM, you need to [**make sure you have CompSoc membership**](/join 'Click to go to the EUSA CompSoc membership page.').

We also allow people to run on the night, if you did not have time to create manifestos.

_The views expressed on the following manifestos are the candidates' own and do not represent those of CompSoc. They are hosted here for the purposes of facilitating EUSA elections._

| Role                    | Candidate          | Manifesto Link                                                                                       |

We hope you think carefully about who you choose to elect — please vote based on manifestos and speeches! Note that you may also vote for RON (reopen nominations) for all positions. You also need EUSA CompSoc membership.

Election candidates - please remember the time limit for your speeches (1 minute for technical secretary, 3 minutes for treasurer). If you haven't gotten membership yet, **do that now**!

## Constitutional Amendments

We also have the following constitutional amendment to vote on:

- [Change the EDI rep to an elected position](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/constitution/pull/41)

See you on the night,

CompSoc ❤️ You!
