On Wednesday at 6pm we have our monthly Student Tech Meetup as well as our Annual General Meeting. Mark yourself as going [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/2546058098799848/) so we have enough food for you!

If you haven't submitted a manifesto and would still like to run for election, please read [the elections page](https://comp-soc.com/blog/2019/03/03/march-agm.html).
