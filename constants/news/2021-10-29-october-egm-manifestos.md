## Event Details

On Friday (today) at 18:30 we have this year's first monthly Student Tech Meetup as well as our Emergency General Meeting to elect some new committee members! Here are the session details, and the election manifestos.

- **Venue:** Online (on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/compsocedinburgh) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOEMTnIKR29AnSVVdLQZg3Q)). No tickets required!
- **Time:** 18:30 - est. 20:30 BST

### Programme

**Dylan Thinnes** - Why We Learn Languages

> Our programming languages are Turing-complete, meaning they all can solve the same problems - so why do we bother to learn more than one?  
> In this talk, we'll go over how programming languages shape (for better or worse) the way we think about problems.  
> We'll go over languages you have heard of, some that are more obscure, and even some "joke" languages, and see what they all bring to the table.

**CompSoc Committee** - Election

> We're holding an election to elect a new Vice President, 1st Year Representative, and 3rd Year Representative.  
> Candidates will give 1 minute speeches (2 minutes for VP), and the audience may be ask questions.  
> See below for details.
