On Wednesday at 6pm we have our monthly Student Tech Meetup as well as our Annual General Meeting. Mark yourself as going [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/511212792850976/) so we have enough food for you!

If you haven't submitted a manifesto and would still like to run for election, please read [the elections page](https://comp-soc.com/blog/2020/02/12/march-agm.html).

We hope you think carefully about who you choose to elect — please vote based on manifestos and speeches! Note that you may also vote for Ron (reopen nominations) for all positions.

Election candidates - please remember that if you are running for President, VP, Secretary or Treasurer, your speech may be up to 2 minutes. Other roles have up to 1 minute. If you haven't bought membership yet, do that now.

See you then!

CompSoc <3 You!
