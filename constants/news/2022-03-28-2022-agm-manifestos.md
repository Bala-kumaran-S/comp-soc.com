On Tuesday at 18:00, we'll have this year's Annual General Meeting, as well as our Student Tech Meetup. Here are the session details, and the election manifestos.

**Venue:** TechCube Zero, or Online (on YouTube). No tickets required!
**Time:** 18:00 - est. 20:30 BST
**Food:** Free fancy Civerinos pizza

**Programme:**

**Dietmar Kuhl, Senior Engineer at Bloomberg** - Quicker Sorting

> Quicksort is a well-known sorting algorithm used to implement sort functionality in many libraries, but a textbook implementation of the algorithm is actually not that quick. Some small additions can improve the implementation significantly. This presentation starts with a simple implementation and makes incremental improvements to eventually yield a proper generic and fast sorting function. All code will be in C++ but it should be possible to follow the majority of the reasoning with knowledge of another programming language.

**CompSoc** - Committee Elections and Votes on Constitutional Amendments

> We're holding an election to elect a new committee. Candidates will give 1-minute speeches (2 minutes for President, Secretary, and Treasurer), and the audience may ask questions. We'll also vote on some constitutional amendments. See below for details.

## Election Details

If you want to vote in the EGM, you need to [make sure you have CompSoc membership](/join).

We also allow people to run on the night, if you did not have time to create manifestos.

We hope you think carefully about who you choose to elect tomorrow — please vote based on manifestos and speeches! Note that you may also vote for Ron (reopen nominations) for all positions. You also need EUSA CompSoc membership.

Election candidates - please remember that if you are running for President, VP, Secretary or Treasurer, your speech may be up to 2 minutes. Other roles have up to 1 minute. If you haven't gotten membership yet, do that now!

## Constitutional Amendments

We also have the following constitutional amendments to vote on:

- [Give EDI rep a spot on the committee](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/constitution/pull/32)
- Cleanup and mandatory EUSA clauses ([1](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/constitution/pull/31) and [2](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/constitution/pull/33))

See you tomorrow,

CompSoc ❤ You!
